-in:file:s min_cst_0.5.1LJL_A_0001.pdb # the PDB file of the structure on which point mutations should be made

-fa_max_dis 9.0 # optional -- if not given, the default value of 9.0 Angstroms is used.
-ddg::iterations 50 # 50 is the recommended number of iterations
-ddg::dump_pdbs true # write out PDB files for the structures, one for the wildtype and one for the pointmutant for each iteration
-ignore_unrecognized_res # optional -- if there are residues in the input PDB file that Rosetta cannot recognize, ignore them instead of quitting with an error message
-ddg::local_opt_only false # recommended: local optimization restricts the sidechain optimization to only the 8 A neighborhood of the mutation (equivalent to row 13)
-ddg::min_cst true # use distance restraints (aka constraints) during the backbone minimization phase
-constraints::cst_file 1LJL_A_input.cst # the set of constraints to use during minimization which should reflect distances in the original (non-pre-relaxed) structure

-in::file::fullatom # read the input PDB file as a fullatom structure
-ddg::mean false # do not report the mean energy
-ddg::min true # report the minimum energy
-ddg::sc_min_only false # do not minimize only the backbone during the backbone minimization phase
-ddg::ramp_repulsive true # perform three rounds of minimization (and not just the default 1 round) where the weight on the repulsive term is increased from 10% to 33% to 100%
-mute all # optional -- silence all of the log-file / stdout output generated by this protocol
-unmute core.optimization.LineMinimizer # optional -- unsilence a particular tracer
