This directory contains the protein alignments for the study. 

mafft_alignments/
	Protein alignments of all of the sequences. Created using the software MAFFT (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)
	
mapped_mafft_alignments/
	Protein alignments that context the sequence of the pdb aligned along with the other protein sequences in the dataset. These were also created using the software MAFFT.
